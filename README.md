# Movie Recommendation System

A recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on collaborative filtering techniques.  
This project was developed as part of my MCA coursework and focuses on applying machine learning to real-world applications.

## Features
- Recommends movies based on user preferences
- Collaborative filtering approach
- Uses Python and machine learning libraries

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How It Works
1. Collects and preprocesses movie and user rating data  
2. Applies collaborative filtering to find similarity between users/items  
3. Generates a list of recommended movies for each user  

## Future Improvements
- Add content-based filtering
- Improve UI for better interaction
- Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit
